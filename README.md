Implementation and testing of a proposed scene classifier using KMeans clustering,  pSLA/NMF, and discriminative classifiers.

A python implementation of a Scene Classifier trained and tested on an alternative dataset (MIT Places) for performance analysis. 

Parameter tuning was done due to time contraints and a lack of computational resources. See 'Final_Report.pdf' for the findings and analysis.
